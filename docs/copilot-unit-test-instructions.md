# GitHub Copilot Unit Test Instructions

> **Note**: These instructions apply specifically to writing unit tests for this project. Follow these guidelines when generating or modifying test files.

## Test Philosophy & Standards

### Always execute these steps in order when unit testing!!!!
- Add comments to outline the tests we need to write to fully cover the delete functionality in the file. 
- The comments should be followed by empty tests with their title and description. 
- Once you write a test, run it in verbose mode. 
- Fix any problems found then run again until everything passes. 
- When that is done, stop and prompt me to verify.
